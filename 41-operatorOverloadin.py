# other functions to use: 
# __eq__() to check for equality
# __lt__() to check if an object should be considered lower than another with the < operator
# __le__() for lower or equal (<=)
# __ge__() for greater or equal (>=)
# __ne__() for not equal (!=)
# Then you have methods to interoperate with arithmetic operations:

# __add__() respond to the + operator
# __sub__() respond to the â€“ operator
# __mul__() respond to the * operator
# __truediv__() respond to the / operator
# __floordiv__() respond to the // operator
# __mod__() respond to the % operator
# __pow__() respond to the ** operator
# __rshift__() respond to the >> operator
# __lshift__() respond to the << operator
# __and__() respond to the & operator
# __or__() respond to the | operator
# __xor__() respond to the ^ operator
